# turn-proto

Repository containing a sans-IO implementation of the TURN (RFC5766) protocol
and STUN parsing and writing in the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Why sans-io?

A couple of reasons: reusability, and testability.

Without being bogged down in the details of how IO happens, the same sans-IO
implementation can be used without prescribing the IO pattern that an application
must follow. Instead, the application (or parent library) has much more freedom
in how bytes are transferred between peers. It is possible to use a sans-IO
library in either a synchronous or within an asynchronous runtime.

sans-IO also allows easy testing of any specific state the sans-IO
implementation might find itself in. Combined with a comprehensive test-suite,
this provides assurance that the implementation behaves as expected under all
circumstances.

For other examples of sans-IO implementations, take a look at:

## Structure

### [turn-types](https://github.com/ystreet/turn-proto/tree/main/turn-types)

Contains parsers and writing implementations for TURN related STUN messages and attributes.
Message parsing is zero-copy by default.

### [turn-client-proto](https://github.com/ystreet/turn-proto/tree/main/turn-client-proto)

`turn-client-proto` builds on top of `turn-types` and implements some of the
TURN protocol requirements when communicating with a peer. It does this using a
sans-IO API and thus does no networking calls of its own.

### [turn-server-proto](https://github.com/ystreet/turn-proto/tree/main/turn-server-proto)

`turn-server-proto` builds on top of `turn-types` and implements a TURN server
for communicating with TURN clients. It does this using a sans-IO API and thus
does no networking calls of its own.
